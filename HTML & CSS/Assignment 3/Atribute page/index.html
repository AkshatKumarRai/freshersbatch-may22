                James Gosling OC (born May 19, 1955), often referred to as "Dr. Java," is a Canadian computer scientist,
                best known as the founder and lead designer behind the Java programming language.[3]

                He is known as the father of the Java programming language.[9][10] He got the idea for the Java VM while
                writing a program to port software from a PERQ by translating Perq Q-Code to VAX assembler and emulating
                the hardware. He is generally credited with having invented the Java programming language in
                1994.[11][12][13] He created the original design of Java and implemented the language's original
                compiler and virtual machine.[14] Gosling traces the origins of the approach to his early graduate
                student days, when he created a p-code virtual machine for the lab's DEC VAX computer, so that his
                professor could run programs written in UCSD Pascal. In the work leading to Java at Sun, he saw that
                architecture-neutral execution for widely distributed programs could be achieved by implementing a
                similar philosophy: always program for the same virtual machine.[15] Another contribution of Gosling's
                was co-writing the "bundle" program, known as "shar", a utility thoroughly detailed in Brian Kernighan
                and Rob Pike's book The Unix Programming Environment.[16

                <br> Gosling was with Sun Microsystems between 1984 and 2010 (26 years). At Sun he invented an early
                Unix windowing system called NeWS, which became a lesser-used alternative to the still used X Window,
                because Sun did not give it an open source license<br />
