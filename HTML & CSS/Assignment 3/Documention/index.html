					What is java?
				</header>
				<p>
					Java is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed for having
					lesser implementation dependencies. It is a computing platform for application development. Java is
					fast, secure, and reliable, therefore. It is widely used for developing Java applications in
					laptops, data centers, game consoles, scientific supercomputers, cell phones, etc.
				</p>
				<p>he “Hello World” program is the first
					step towards learning any programming
					language and also one of the simplest
					programs you will learn. All you have
					to do is display the message “Hello World”
					on the screen.

				</p>
				
				<br>
				<p>java is an Object Oriented Programming Language.
					<br> java mainly based on Object Oriented
					Programming are :

				<ul>
					<li>Objects and Classes</li>
					<li>Inheritance</li>
					<li>Polymorphism</li>
					<li>Abstraction</li>

					Objects and Classes
				</header>
				<p>
					An entity that has state and behavior is known as an object e.g., chair, bike, marker, pen, table,
					car, etc.

					A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which
					objects are created. It is a logical entity. It can't be physical.

					Inheritance
				</header>
				<p>
					Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of
					a parent object. It is an important part of OOPs
					(Object Oriented programming system).

					The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes
					that are built upon existing classes. When you inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods
					and fields of the parent class. Moreover, you can add new methods and fields in your current class
					also.

					Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship which is also known as a parent-child relationship.

					Polymorphism
				</header>
				<p>
					Polymorphism in Java is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways.
					Polymorphism is derived from 2 Greek words: poly and morphs. The word "poly" means many and "morphs"
					means forms. So polymorphism means many forms.

					There are two types of polymorphism in Java: compile-time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism. We
					can perform polymorphism in java by method overloading and method overriding.

					Abstraction
				</header>

				<p>
					Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the
					user.

					Another way, it shows only essential things to the user and hides the internal details, for example,
					sending SMS where you type the text and send the message. You don't know the internal processing
					about the message delivery.

					There are two ways to achieve abstraction in java

					Abstract class (0 to 100%)
					Interface (100%)

					Encapsulation
				</header>
				<p>
					Encapsulation in Java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit, for
					example, a capsule which is mixed of several medicines.

					encapsulation in java
					We can create a fully encapsulated class in Java by making all the data members of the class
					private. Now we can use setter and getter methods to set and get the data in it.

					The Java Bean class is the example of a fully encapsulated class.
